  - `01_data_exploration.ipynb`: Data exploration and manipulation.
  - `02_model_development.ipynb`: Machine learning model development.
  - `03_analysis.ipynb`: Analysis of results.
  - `04_evaluation.ipynb`: Evaluation and performance metrics.

- `data/`: Includes the input datasets and the predicted outcomes.
  - `train.xlsx`: Training data.
  - `test.xlsx`: Testing data.
  - `test_predicted.csv`: Predicted outcomes for the test data.
